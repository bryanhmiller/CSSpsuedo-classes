/*#CSS pseudo-class exercise

> For this exercise you can't add any classes or ids

1. Currently, the `<li>` items are block level elements. Add correct styles to remove the bullets 
and display them as inline elements.
1. The three `<span>` elements should be displayed as block elements with a 1 pixel border and 25 
pixel margin on **all** sides.
1. In the `article` element with the class `n-child`, add a 1 pixel border around every even 
numbered section element.
